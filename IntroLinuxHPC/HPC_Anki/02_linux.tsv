How lasting is Linux command-line knowledge for researchers?	Many of the commands used in UNIX/Linux environments have been around for thirty, forty, fifty years and more and are still in active development. A researcher who learns these commands will be able to use them for the rest of their research career.	
Why doesn't Linux on HPC use a Graphic User Interface?	Resources are considered important on an HPC; a GUI has an extra layer on top of constrained command.	that is contrained in its functionality. The Linux CLI is fast, flexible, and stable compared to a GUI.
What are the benefits of Linux being Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) for HPC?	While there are advantages from the cost, and even total cost of ownership (TCOS), there are operational and engineering advantages by being able to modify software to fit particular hardware and topology needs.	
What is a disadvantage of using FOSS applications on an HPC?	There is a significant time investment required by operators to build software from source; every software application typically requires dependencies to also be built from source. The end result is software that performs very well (typically 33% faster).	
What sort of client is required to login from a remote location to Spartan or other HPC systems?	Nearly all HPC systems require a user access the system with a Secure Shell client (SSh). The SSH session protects the data from being hijacked by people snooping on the session, and thus collecting information such as the username and password.	
What sort of connection clients are prohibited on Spartan and other HPC systems?	It is typical for HPC systems to block access for any cliet or protocol that sends information (such as usernames and passwords) in plain-text, which can be easily captured by a third party. This includes rlogin, telnet, and ftp.	
What SSH clients are available for different operating systems?	Linux systems will almost always have OpenSSH as part of the distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, Slackware, SuSE, etc), as will MacOS X. MS-Windows systems have MobaXterm and PuTTy as SSH clients. Newer versions of MS-Windows also have OpenSSH clients available.	
What sort of client on a local system should one use to transfer files to and from Spartan and other HPC systems?	A file transfer client that uses SSH for the file transfer and authentication process. This can include protocols such as SFTP and SCP, and utilities like rsync. SFTP client applications, such as WinSCP or Filezilla provide a convinent GUI interface. 	
What is the correct command for connecting to Spartan via SSH on the command line?	ssh username@spartan.hpc.unimelb.edu.au ; the same format can be used for other systems (i.e., ssh username@host).	
What SSH option should be used to connect to to Spartan then to other systems? What is the alternative and why is it unsafe?	Using SSH agent forwarding the command ssh -A option can connect to a remote system which then can be used to connect to a third system. It is safer than copying the private key to the remote system. Private keys should be stored only on the private device that they were built on.	
What is the advantage of a user's ssh configuration file?	An SSH configuration file allows an alias to a given hostname and user, reduces keystrokes, and providing user and host specific options that can differ from the system-wide SSH configuration on the user's system.	
What are the advantages of passwordless SSH?	Passwordless SSH provides adds an extra authentication factor and allows users to programmatically access a system in an non-interactive way.	
How is passwordless SSH implemented?	Passwordless SSH is implemented with keypair authentication, consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key is stored on host systems and the private key must be kept secret and stored on the user's device. Instructions for setting up a keypair are available at https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/ssh	
What is the file system hierarchy in UNIX-like operating systems?	"The directory system is like a tree, starting from the root directory ""/"" and with subdirectories (branches), such as /bin, /home. /usr etc., and further subdirectories under those."	
"What is meant by the statement ""Everything in the UNIX system is a file"" (Kernighan & Pike, 1984, 41)?"	The operating system regards everything as a file; including plain files, directories, and devices.	
What are the different types of files on a UNIX-like system?	The file command will illustrate file types; e.g.,  text, binary, data, empty, character, block, etc	
"What is the implication for data throughput when Grace Hopper said ""Mind your nanoseconds""?"	Grace Hopper's remark refers to the distance that data has to travel in order to be processed. Throughput consists of bandwidth multiplied by latency; using a road analogy, the width of the road and the smoothness of the surface. Data should be close to where the processing occurs.	
What do the following basic environmental commands do? whoami, pwd, date, cal, and ls	whoami prints the effective userid, pwd prints the working directory, date displays the current date and time, cal provides a calendar, and ls provides a directory listing.	
What do the following command-line shortcuts represent? ~ . .. and /	The ~ characters is a shortcut to the user's home directory (/home/username), the . represents the current working directory, the .. command represents one directory level closer to root from the current working directory, and / represents either the root directory, or a directory delimiter.	
What does entering tab do when typing a command?	Tab completion provides a list of available commands, directories, or filenames that are possible from the keystrokes entered. It can save time and typing!	
"What is the design principle of UNIX commands compared to ""enterprise software""?"	"Commands in this environment are built with a default execution, based around a principle of ""do one thing, do it well, and play nice with others"". Commands are modular, flexible, and robust. This contrasts with most enterprise software which is feature rich and inflexible."	
How are commands extended or altered from their default behaviour?	Commands have a variety of options expressed as <command> --<option> (full word version) or <command> -<option> (abbreviated version). An examples is `ls -Flahrt`, which lists the contents of the current working directory with the options of file indicator, long-listing, all files, human-readable size expression, and reverse time order.	
How is information about commands and options accessed?	UNIX-like systems have online manuals accessed via man pages which provide terse, but complete information. The info command provides information in a more verbose manner. The whatis command provides command descriptions only, and man -k or apropos searches man page descriptions for keywords (e.g., apropos compiler).	
What are pipes in UNIX-like commands?	The pipe is typically used to redirect the output of one command as the input to another for further processing. Multiple commands can be piped in sequence to develop some very specific outcomes. Some simple example; who -u | less, who | wc -l.	
What's the difference between the commands `more` and `less`?	"Both commands are present on UNIX-like systems and allow information to be displayed to standard output. The `more` command (e.g., `more $filename`) displays files one screenful at a time, but can only traverse in a forward-manner. In contast, `less` is a newer command that does the same but allows traversal back and forth and searching. ""Less is more""!"	
How does one redirect output of a command to a file?	" By default, output is redirected to standard output (i.e., the screen). To redirect output to a file use the > symbol (e.g., `command > file`). If the command is run again with the redirect it will overwrite the existing content. To append to existing content use a ""double redirect"" symbol (e.g., `command >> file`)."	
Redirection can be expressed from a file to a file (e.g., wc < file) instead of applying the command to a file (e.g., wc file), these results can be slightly different. Why is this so?	A redirection sets up a data stream from the contents of the file to the instruction, whereas applying the command to the file also involves the file's characteristics. 	
What does the `cat` command do?	The cat command will concatenate files and print on the standard output. It is often used in this role to display short files to the terminal output - note the plural, cat can operate on multiple files simultaneously (e.g., cat file1 file2) and when combined with standard redirects can prepend one file with another (e.g., cat file2 file1 >> file3). With the -A option (cat -A file1) it will display a file's non-printing characters. The cat command can also be used to create short-text files where a file does not exist and can be terminated with Cntrl-D.	
What is the maximum length of a filename in Linux and what characters are excluded?	Most modern Linux filesystems have a directory limit of 255 bytes (which is 255 ASCII characters). Filenames can be constructed of any characters except the forward slash, which is for directory navigation, and the null character. 	
What common alternatives to non-printing characters (e.g., spaces) are used for filenames?	Underscores (snake_case), capitalisation (camelCase or PascalCase), hyphens (kebab-case) are common alternatives to spaces which are often used as delimiters.	
What does the `touch` command do?	The touch command either creates a file with no content or updates the modification time.	
What does case sensitivity in filenames mean?	Case sensitivity refers to whether or not an operating system sees FILE or file as different file names or the same. A case sensitive operating system (e.g., UNIX-like) considers them to be different filenames (e.g., FILE, File, FiLe, file).	
What are the three main text editors available for the Linux command line and what are their main features?	Nano (first release 1989) is easy to use, Vim (first release as vi in 1976), known for its efficiency and speed, and Emacs (first releae in 1976) known for its modular extensions.	
What are some commands that can be used to copy files to a user's directory on an HPC from an external source?	The main commands for such an action would be wget, curl, or rsync. A git clone command can be used to copy an entire repository. The wget command can copy recursively, wheread cURL can copy with a wider range of protocols and can upload, but is not recursive.	
What is the command to copy a file within a local system?	The cp command followed by the source and destination can copy a single file. Common options to cp include -r (recursive) to copy an entire directory, -a (archive, keep ownership and permissions, recursive), and -u (update, only copy if the source is newer than the destination).	
What is the scp command and what are some common options for it?	The scp command combines SSH with cp functionality, allowing secure copying between systems. Common options are the same as the cp command, i.e., -r (recursive) to copy an entire directory, -a (archive, keep ownership and permissions, recursive), and -u (update, only copy if the source is newer than the destination). It is normally required that the remote system has a public IP address.	
What is the preferred command to synchronise files and directories and how does it operate?	"The rsync command keeps directories in sync by tracking changes to files, thus allowing existing content to be updated, rather than being re-written. The general structure is `rsync -options source destination`. Common options include -a -v, -z, and --update (archive, verbose, compress on transfer, only copy if source is newer), or --delete (delete files on destination that aren't present in source), and --dry-run (display the changes without actually making the change). Note that rsync is ""trailing slash sensitive"". A trailing / on a source means ""copy the contents of this directory"". Without a trailing slash it means ""copy the directory"". "	
What is the command to create a directory in Linux and what are some common options?	The command `mkdir dir1` will create a directory. Multiple directories can be created simultaneously with space delimiters (e.g., mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3) or a path of directories (e.g., mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3).	
What is the command to move a file or directory?	The mv (move) command will move (and rename) a file. There are options for -f (force), -i (interactive), and -n (no clobber). If more than one of these is selected only the last one is applied.	
How can the difference within two files be determined?	The diff command compares two files line-by-line (diff file1 file2). The sdiff provides a side-by-side view of file differences. The comm command compares files line-by-line and outputs columns where lines are unique to file1, unique to file2, and common to both. There is also a diff3 command that compares three files line-by-line!	
Why isn’t the `locate` command often available on HPC systems? What should be used instead?	The locate command is resource-intensive on a large system with many users. The find command is an alternative with many options for more restrictive search criteria.	
What are the globbing examples for all characters, single characters, and ranges?	The metacharacter * stands for all characters, the ? Stands for a single character, and a range is bracketed with a hyphen for scope e.g., [0-4]. An example is find . -name *.log	
What is the command for searching for a string within a file? What command would indicate a case insensitive search in all files in a directory?	The command is grep; a global search for regular expression and print. A case insensitive search in all files would be grep -i RegEx DIRNAME/*	
How did the grep command come about? What is the lesson from this?	The grep command came about from taking functionality from the ed line editor. Is an example of code re-use, which is fundamental to efficient software development.	
Why would one encapsulate a string in a command like grep with quotation marks?	The use of single quotes means the string will be interpreted literally, and the command will not invoke any variables contained in the string.	
What is the command for removing a directory? Why might it fail?	The command rmdir removes a directory. By default, it will fail if the directory is not empty.	
What are some dangers of combining wildcards with the rm command?	With the rm command, a wildcard removes everything associated with the option. e.g., rm *.bak will remove all files with the .bak suffix; a typo can cause significant problems. e.g., rm * .bak will remove all files in the directory.	
What is the command to remove a file? Can it be used to remove a directory?	The rm command removes a file, rm FILENAME. It can remove directories with the -r (recusrive) option, which will also remove any files in the directory.	
What does the rm -rf command do?	The rm -rf command removes the specified directory, all subdirectories, and all files. With the -f option it does so without any confirmation. Use with care!	
Can one recover files from the command-line that have been removed?	In most cases, no, unless there is a backup. It is possible to scan a disk looking for file content as rm removes the metadata of a file, not the content. This is very time-consuming and will not be done on an HPC system.
