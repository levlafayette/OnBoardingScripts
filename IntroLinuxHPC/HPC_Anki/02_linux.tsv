How lasting is Linux command-line knowledge for researchers?	Many of the commands used in UNIX/Linux environments have been around for thirty, forty, fifty years and more and are still in active development. A researcher who learns these commands will be able to use them for the rest of their research career.
Why doesn't Linux on HPC use a Graphic User Interface?	Resources are considered important on an HPC; a GUI has an extra layer on top of command	that is contrained in its functionality. The Linux CLI is fast, flexible, and stable compared to a GUI.
What are the benefits of Linux being Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) for HPC?	While there are advantages from the cost, and even total cost of ownership (TCOS), there are operational and engineering advantages by being able to modify software to fit particular hardware and topology needs.
What is a disadvantage of using FOSS applications on an HPC?	There is a significant time investment required by operators to build software from source; every software application typically requires dependencies to also be built from source. The end result is software that performs very well (typically 33% faster).
What sort of client is required to login from a remote location to Spartan or other HPC systems?	Nearly all HPC systems require a user access the system with a Secure Shell client (SSh). The SSH session protects the data from being hijacked by people snooping on the session, and thus collecting information such as the username and password.
What sort of connection clients are prohibited on Spartan and other HPC systems?	It is typical for HPC systems to block access for any cliet or protocol that sends information (such as usernames and passwords) in plain-text, which can be easily captured by a third party. This includes rlogin, telnet, and ftp.
What SSH clients are available for different operating systems?	Linux systems will almost always have OpenSSH as part of the distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, Slackware, SuSE, etc), as will MacOS X. MS-Windows systems have MobaXterm and PuTTy as SSH clients. Newer versions of MS-Windows also have OpenSSH clients available.
What sort of client on a local system should one use to transfer files to and from Spartan and other HPC systems?	A file transfer client that uses SSH for the file transfer and authentication process. This can include protocols such as SFTP and SCP, and utilities like rsync. SFTP client applications, such as WinSCP or Filezilla provide a convinent GUI interface. 
What is the correct command for connecting to Spartan via SSH on the command line?	ssh username@spartan.hpc.unimelb.edu.au ; the same format can be used for other systems (i.e., ssh username@host).
What is the advantage of a user's ssh configuration file?	An SSH configuration file allows an alias to a given hostname and user, reduces keystrokes, and providing user and host specific options that can differ from the system-wide SSH configuration on the user's system.
What are the advantages of passwordless SSH?	Passwordless SSH provides adds an extra authentication factor and allows users to programmatically access a system in an non-interactive way.
How is passwordless SSH implemented?	Passwordless SSH is implemented with keypair authentication, consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key is stored on host systems and the private key must be kept secret and stored on the user's device. Instructions for setting up a keypair are available at https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/ssh
What is the file system hierarchy in UNIX-like operating systems?	The directory system is like a tree, starting from the root directory "/" and with subdirectories (branches), such as /bin, /home. /usr etc., and further subdirectories under those.
What is meant by the statement "Everything in the UNIX system is a file" (Kernighan & Pike, 1984, 41)?	The operating system regards everything as a file; including plain files, directories, and devices.
What is the implication for data throughput when Grace Hopper said "Mind your nanoseconds"?	Grace Hopper's remark refers to the distance that data has to travel in order to be processed. Throughput consists of bandwidth multiplied by latency; using a road analogy, the width of the road and the smoothness of the surface. Data should be close to where the processing occurs.
What do the following basic environmental commands do? whoami, pwd, date, cal, and ls
