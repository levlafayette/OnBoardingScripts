Why It Matters

BRAF is a human gene that makes a protein (imaginatively) named B-Raf. This protein is involved in sending signals inside 
cells, which are involved in directing cell growth. In 2002, it was shown to be faulty (mutated) in human cancers. In 
particular, the difference between the two files "ATVKSRWSGS" and "ATEKSRWSGS" is the difference that leads to 
susceptibility to metastatic melanoma.
