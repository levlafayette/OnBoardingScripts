**Slurm Workload Manager**

The Slurm Workload Manager, originally the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM), is used on Spartan. Yes, it is named after the 
"popular intergalactic beverage" from the animated television series Futurama.

The workload manager (scheduler plus resource manager) began development as a collaborative effort primarily by Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, SchedMD, Linux NetworX, Hewlett-Packard, and Groupe Bull as a Free Software resource manager.

As early as November 2015, TOP500 list of most powerful computers in the world indicated that Slurm is the workload manager on six of the top 
ten systems, and by 2019 Slurm was the workload manager on about 60% of the TOP500 supercomputers. Slurm's design is very modular with about 
100 optional plugins, and extensive reporting tools.

There is a repository of scripts developed by Bernie Pope for converting PBS to Slurm:
