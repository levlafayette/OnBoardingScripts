Welcome to the Introduction to Linux for High Performance Computing workshop. My name is Lev Lafayette and I'll be providing 
the content for this workshop. This workshop is provided by University of Melbourne's Research Computing Services, which 
provides high performance computing, cloud computing, and data storage.

This workshop consists of four modules, each designed to take up approximately sixty minutes.

The first module is "Supercomputers and Spartan", which will provide a high-level overview of supercomputers and Spartan, 
the general-purposes supercomputer at the University of Melbourne.

The second module is "The Linux Command Line Environment", which will cover the main interface for accessing a 
supercomputer. For some of you, this will be very new.

The third module is "Environment Modules and Job Submission", which covers how to access and change software applications 
that have been installed on the system, and an introduction to the job submission system.

The fourth module is "Slurm Job Examples", which covers job submission with the Slurm Workload Manager with various 
configurations and applications.

When you have completed the four modules you will have the knowledge of how high performance computer systems operate and 
the ability to navigate the system and submit jobs to the HPC system.
