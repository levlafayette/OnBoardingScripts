There is a significant amount of resources available for using Spartan and HPC.

The canonical version of this workshop is available on github at:

https://github.com/levlafayette/OnBoardingScripts/tree/main/IntroLinuxHPC

An older version of the course and content, with sample code is available on github: 
https://github.com/levlafayette/SpartanIntro

There a lot of information about HPC at the University of Melbourne is available at https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au.

There are plenty of job submissions examples in the /apps/examples directory. We will be using some of those in this course.

Support tickets can be submitted through the HPC dashboard site: https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/training_help/

Several other courses are also conducted by Research Computing Services, such as Advanced Linux and Shell Scripting for HPC, Regular Expressions with Linux on HPC, Parallel Processing, GPU Applications and Programming, Mathematical Applications and Programming, and more.

There is even a book which a good portion of this content comes from:

Lev Lafayette, "Supercomputing with Linux", Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing, 2015
https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/998173

This book is "pay what you want", which means you can get it for free. If any contributions are made, they will be forwarded to the charity "Effective Altruism".

This course, along with the Spartan HPC Advanced and Spartan Parallel Processing, is designed to satisify the examinable content from the International HPC Certification forum for the "HPC Use" and "HPC Knowledge" Basic skill trees.

Citing Spartan

If you use Spartan to obtain results for a publication, we'd appreciate if you'd cite our service, including the DOI below. 
This makes it easy for us demonstrate research impact, helping to secure ongoing funding for expansion and user support.
