Accounts and Projects

To use Spartan, you must have an account on the system. Everyone with an account must belong to at least one project (one 
account, many projects). Every project must be led by a University of Melbourne researcher. Members of a project can be 
researchers or research support staff from anywhere. Projects have their own project directory for files (500GB default, can 
be increased to 1TB or 10TB with approval). User home directories, in comparison, are 50GB. Further, the project directories 
are on a faster network and therefore jobs will typically run faster when launched from the project directory and when data 
is stored on the project directory.

Spartan uses its an authentication that is tied to the university Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). The login URL 
is `https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/karaage`, using the system "Karaage" (yes, named after the Japanese chilli chicken 
dish), which was originally developed at the Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing. It is here that you can also set 
up an account or project. There are a number of steps to this process.

If you are setting up an account, you must specify which project you wish to join. The project leader will then approve you, 
the system's administrators will confirm this, then you will be prompted to set your password for Spartan.

If you are starting a new project, you will begin at the same URL, but select `create new project` instead. You will be 
prompted to describe the project. It is suggested that you provide 3-4 lines of detail, keeping in mind that the next step 
is approval from Research Computing Services. We need to be convinced that this project will be a good use of Spartan's 
resources, so something like "A project for my PhD" will not be accepted!

The opportunity is also provided here to mention if you need specific software or access to specialist partitions.
