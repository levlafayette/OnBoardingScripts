Do You Need HPC?

High Performance Computing (HPC) typically takes a large number of commodity systems and combines them, as a cluster, to 
become a tightly coupled single-system. This provides capacity, to run a large number of computing tasks simultaneously, and 
capability, to run large-scale parallel tasks. If your desktop system is too slow for your "big datasets" or the problems 
too complex, High Performance Computing (HPC) is the tool you need.

Each individual core in an HPC system is no different to the cores in a personal computer. What makes an HPC different is 
when there is the capacity to submit many jobs or the capability for a computing task to in parallel. Usually, the former is 
carried out by scheduler directives, and the latter through coding for parallel tasks to run simultaneously.

Because they are designed for optimisation and performance HPC systems typically run on the Linux operating system, which 
scales efficiently and effectively. Further, due to latency and performance reasons, they also have limited use of 
interactive application use or the use of graphical interface. Instead, HPC tends to operate with a command-line interface 
with application use in batch mode.

Because the growth in data is faster than improvements in computer systems, more people are finding that their datasets are 
"too large" to process on local systems. Further, sometimes the software that they need is "too complex" or 
resource-intensive, and they would like a managed service.

In both these cases, HPC might be the right tool for the job. HPC is certainly the best tool for processing large and 
complex datasets. But it is not the only tool, and in some cases alternatives (e.g., virtual machines in the cloud) should 
be sought instead.

However, HPC is primarily a tool for computation. It is not always the best tool for real-time visualization and 
manipulation, because latency and bandwidth are real issues.

Also, HPC systems are almost always Linux systems that operate with the command-line interface. It would be hard for them to 
scale in a stable manner otherwise, or to gain the performance benefits that users want. If your software is, for example, 
is designed for MS-Windows and operates only with a GUI, HPC might not be the right tool for you. The Melbroune Research 
Cloud, also operated by Research Computing Services, might be a better choice.
