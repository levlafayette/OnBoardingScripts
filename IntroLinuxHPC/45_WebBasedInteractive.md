**Web-Based Interactive**

Spartan has a web-based interactive job submission system, OpenOn Demand. This is subject to some stricter limits, but is very handy if one 
wishes to invoke a GUI environment.

Open OnDemand provides access to interactive environments, such as RStudio and Jupyter notebooks.

Open OnDemand is a HPC portal that provides web access to HPC resources, such a file management, command-line access, job management, and 
access to certain web-enabled applications (e.g., RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks). To access OpenOnDemand one needs to create a session from a 
Spartan login website with the user name and password.

Login to Open OnDemand at the following URL

Most of the menu items are self-explanatory. The "Files" menu item provides a GUI interface to a user's home directory. The "Jobs" menu has two 
parts, an "Active Jobs" application and a "Job Composer". The "Clusters" menu item provides an application for command-line access to Spartan 
in a web browser. The "Interactive Apps" item provides links, replicated on a left-hand menu item, to a Jupyter Notebook server and an RStudio 
Server. In addition, there is an image for managing your interactive sessions. a help icon, a user icon, and a log out menu item.
