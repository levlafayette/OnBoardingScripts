Exploring The Environment

Once a user has logged in for the first time, it is time to put finger to keyboard and start entering commands. This is actually very important. The more that one practices these commands the more they become second-nature as the neural pathways are formed.


These first commands are about establishing familiarity with your environment: Who am I? Where am I? What's the date? What's here?


whoami; "Who Am I?, which will print the effective user id. Handy if you are logged on to multiple terminal sessions on 
different systems at the same time!

pwd; "Print working directory". A lot of commands in this environment are abbreviated statements. Reducing keystrokes is 
important!

date; Print the date.

cal; Display a calender. By default, the current month and year are displayed. The month and year can be specified (e.g., 
cal 11 2023 or cal nov 2023). An interesting issue arises in cal 9 1752Links to an external site. - what happened then?!

ls; "List" a directory listing, using the working directory by default.

There are also the following common shortcuts, which will be illustrated in later examples. Compare this information with what was provided in the file system hierarchy.

~	Home directory 
.	Current working directory
..	One directory level closer to root 
/ 	Root directory, directory delimiter
