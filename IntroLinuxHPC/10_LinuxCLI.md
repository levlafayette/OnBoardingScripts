This is a GNU/Linux CLI World

HPC systems are very much orientated towards performance, resource efficiency, and flexibility. This means that they operate 
on the command-line shell. GUI environments are possible, but behind every GUI there is actually actually a command-line 
statement, where the variables and options are constrained. For many, this is a new level and a new environment for 
computing. However, it is well-worth learning. Many of the commands that are used here have been in existence for thirty, 
forty, fifty years, and more and are still in development. The skills that you learn here will be available for the rest of 
your research career.

"GNU" is a recursive acronym for "GNU's not UNIX", and refers to a collection of utility commands in the command-line shell 
environment that was developed by the Free Software Foundation that were "UNIX compatible".  "Linux" refers to the kernel of 
the operating system, the interface that sits between the hardware and the shell. When you use the command line you are very 
close to the hardware. The combination of GNU and Linux is very important in the HPC world.

In addition, the critical software for running HPC systems, such as the Message Passing Interface (MPI), and nearly all 
scientific applications are designed to work with GNU/Linux in the first instance. Linux is based on UNIX, UNIX is based on 
Multics, and that's over fifty-five years of development in computer science.

Finally, the operating system and many applications are provided as "free and open-source". Apart from being relatively 
inexpensive (even in terms of the total cost of ownership) and convenient, from an engineering perspective (managing 
licenses is annoying), FOSS is better placed for improvements, optimization, and maintenance. Most of the research software 
installed on an HPC system is compiled from source; this means that it can sometimes take days to get all the components 
working together, but the end result is usually a significant performance improvement, making the time spent worthwhile.
