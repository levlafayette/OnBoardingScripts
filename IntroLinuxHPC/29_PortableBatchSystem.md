**The Portable Batch System**

Invoking modules usually occurs within a script for the Portable Batch System (PBS), which performs job scheduling by assigning unattended 
background tasks expressed as batch jobs, among the available resources. These scripts consist of a set of directives to the scheduler and a 
set of shell commands.

It was originally developed by MRJ Technology Solutions under contract to NASA in the early 1990s. Released as an open-source product as 
OpenPBS, it was forked by Adaptive Computing as TORQUE (Terascale Open-source Resource and QUEue Manager). Many of the original engineering 
team now part of Altair Engineering who have their own version, PBSPro.

The batch system typically consists of a resource manager (e.g., TORQUE) and a job scheduler (e.g., Maui, Moab), or a combination (e.g., 
PBSPro, Slurm). TORQUE and MOAB was used on the Edward HPC system. Slurm is used on Spartan.

It is important to note that whilst the concepts used in schedulers are very similar each and every HPC system will have its own specialised 
commands (e.g., for their accounting system, for their modules etc). Thus, whilst it is possible to use scripts from another system as a guide 
for ideas, they will not necessarily work on a different system.

Spartan has a large collection of scripts designed specifically for this system in the directory /apps/examples
