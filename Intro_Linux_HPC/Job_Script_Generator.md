**Job Script Generator**

It is recommended that one makes use of the numerous application-specific examples in /apps/examples and modify them for a specific job run. 
In addition, RCS has also produced a job submission generator.

The job script generator goes through the various options in a stepwise manner and, in that sense, is more flexible than the crafted and application-specific examples in the `/apps/examples/` directory.

The generators makes a text files that can be downloaded or copy-and-pasted to Spartan for use.
